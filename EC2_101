What is EC2? : Elastic Compute Cloud

	Virtual Server (Servers) in the cloud that reduce the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes
	allowing you to quickly scale capacity both up and down as your requirements change.

EC2 Pricing Models:

	On Demand 
	 - Pay a fixed rate by the hour (or the second) with no commitment
	 - For users that want the low cost and flexibility
	 - Applications with short term,spiky,or unpredictable workloads
	 - Applications being developed or tested on EC2 

	Reserved
	 - Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance (1 and 3 year terms)
	 - Applications with steady state or predictable usage
	 - Applications that require reserved capacity 
	 - Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further

	Spot
	 - Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity providing for even greater savings.
	 - The instance is terminated if the price goes above what you are bidding
		- If the instance is terminated by the price going up you pay for a partial hour
		- If you terminate the instance you pay for the full hour
	 - Application that have flexible start and end times
	 - Applications that are only feasible at very low computer prices
	 - Users with Urgent computing needs for a large amounts of additional capacity	
	
	Dedicated Hosts
	 - Physical EC2 Server dedicated for your use. Help you reduce cost by allowing you to use your existing server-bound licenses
	 - Useful for regulator requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
	 - May be purchased On-Demand and Reserved 
 
What is Amazon EBS?:

	- Allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 Instances, Once attached you create a file system on top of these volumes
	run databases or use them in any way you would use a block device (Virtual Hard Disk)
	- EBS are placed in a specific Availability Zone where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component
	- EC2 Instance needs to be in the same availability zone as your EBSi

Types of Amazon EBS:

	SSD :
	- General Purpose SSD (GP2)
		- Balances price and performance for a wide variety of workloads
	- Provisioned IOPS SSD(I01) 
		- Highest Performance SSD Volume for mission-critical low-latency or high-throughput workloadsi

	Magnetic :
	 - Throughput Optimized HDD(ST1) 
		- Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed,throughput intensive workloads
	 - Cold HDD(SC1)
		- Lowest Cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads(File Servers)
	 - Magnetic 
		-Previous Generation
