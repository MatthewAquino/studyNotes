# AZ-900: Describe Cloud Concepts (15-20%)

## Describe the benefits and considerations of using cloud services

* Describe terms such as:
    * [High Availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/checklist/availability)  
      Allows your systems to run without interuption for long periods of time
    * [Scalability](https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/scalability)    
      Insures that you are able to scale your infrastructure up when needed easily 
    * [Elasticity](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/what-is-elastic-computing/)  
      Allows you to scale your servers vertically and horizontally when demand is high and allows you to scale down when demand is low
    * [Agility](https://blog.sysfore.com/agility-on-cloud-a-vital-part-of-cloud-computing/)    
      Allows you to rapidly develop,test, and deploy software appications 
    * [Fault Tolerance](https://www.imperva.com/learn/availability/fault-tolerance/)  
      Allows your servers to continue to function even if one or more parts become unfunctional
    * [Disaster Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-overview)  
      Allows you to recover your Data in the event of a disaster
* Describe the Principles of Economies of Scale [(PDF)](http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/e/4/6e4cb3d1-5004-4024-8d90-6c66c83c17aa/the_economics_of_the_cloud_white_paper.pdf)
* Describe the differences between:
    * [Capital Expenditure (CapEx)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp)  
      Upfront Costs (Fixed Assets, Hardware)
    * [Operational Expenditure (OpEx)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operating_expense.asp)  
      Over time Costs (Rent, Salaries)
* Describe the consumption-based model  
      This is a model that allows you to only pay for resources that are used(Pay as you go)
## Describe the differences between Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

* Describe [Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/what-is-paas/)  
   A platform provided for Devs to use to Develop and test their applications
* Describe [Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/what-is-saas/)  
   This is a piece of software that we have no or very limited control over (Office 365) It is generally done through a software license delivery model 
* Describe [Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/what-is-iaas/)  
   This give you full control of everything to do with your servers outside of the Hardware itself, Iaas provides virtualized comoputing resources over the internet      
* [Compare and contrast the 3 different service types](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/types-of-cloud-computing/)

## Describe the differences between Public, Private and Hybrid cloud models

* Describe [Public cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/what-is-a-public-cloud/)  
   A public cloud is when your infrastructure(Files,Server,ETC) are hosted in a data centre you do not own  
        - Pros : Allows for high scability, Pay as you go(OpEx), Shared responsbility   
        - Cons : Lose Control, May not meet security standards
* Describe [Private cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/what-is-a-private-cloud/)  
   A Private cloud is when your infrastructure(Files,Servers,ETC) are hosted in a data centre that you do own(Cloud Simulation)  
         - Pros : Full Control    
         - Cons : High upfront cost (CapEx), limited Scalibilty, Requires skilled staff 
* Describe [Hybrid cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/overview/what-is-hybrid-cloud-computing/)  
   A hybrid cloud is when your infrastructure(Files,Servers,ETC) are hosted in a mix of data centres that you do and do not own.    
         - Has the pros and cons of the public and private cloud models
* Compare and contrast the 3 different cloud models
