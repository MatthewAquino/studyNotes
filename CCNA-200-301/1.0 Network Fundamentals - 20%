1.1 Explain the role and function of network components

    1.1.a Routers
        A Layer Three Device that connects networks by routing packets from one network to another relying on an IP based routing table to forward these packets.
    1.1.b L2 and L3 switches
        A L2 Switch passes traffic within a network using MAC Address and ARP Table entires, A L3 Switch can do the same function as a L2 Switch
        But with the added functionality of being able to do Static, Dynamic Routing with IP
        A switch has three primary functions
            -Switches forward based on the destination MAC Address
            -Switches use logic to learn MAC address table (Frame Switching,Frame Flooding
            -Switches use STP(Spanning Tree Protocol to prevent loops by causing some interfaces to block meaning they do not send or recieve frames.
    1.1.c Next-generation firewalls and IPS
        A Next Generation Firewall is a device that combines a tradional firewall with other network device filtering funtions such as an IPS(Intrusion Prevention System) 
        An IPS detects and prevents identifed threats.
    1.1.d Access points
        Communicate data packets wirelessly over 2.4 and 5ghz radio frequencies
        Transmits across RF "Channels"
        Follows WI-FI Standards 802.11
    1.1.e Controllers (Cisco DNA Center and WLC)
       WLC (Wireless LAN Controller) Is a device that allows you to centrally manage and confiugre a number of access points in a simplified manner
       Cisco DNA Center is a network management and command center for Cisco DNA 
    1.1.f Endpoints
       An endpint is any device that is phyiscally an end point on a network(Laptops,Desktops,IP Phones,Tablets, etc)
    1.1.g Servers
        A server is a piece of computer hardware or software that provides functionallity for other programs or devices.
        
    
1.2 Describe characteristics of network topology architectures

    1.2.a 2 tier
    1.2.b 3 tier
    1.2.c Spine-leaf
    1.2.d WAN
    1.2.e Small office/home office (SOHO)
    1.2.f On-premises and cloud
    

1.3 Compare physical interface and cabling types

    1.3.a Single-mode fiber, multimode fiber, copper
    1.3.b Connections (Ethernet shared media and point-to-point)
    1.3.c Concepts of PoE
    

1.4 Identify interface and cable issues (collisions, errors, mismatch duplex, and/or speed)

1.5 Compare TCP to UDP

    TCP - Transport Control Protocol : "A reliable protocol", requires a three way handshake to be performed to send data packets and insures that all data is transferred.
    UDP - User Datagram Protocol : "An unreliable protocl",  Does not care if all packets are recieved or dropped.
    
1.6 Configure and verify IPv4 addressing and subnetting


1.7 Describe the need for private IPv4 addressing
    
    Private IPv4 Addresses are a more secure means of providing IPv4 addresses to devices because private IPs are not routable or resolvable across the internet. 
    
    IPv4 Address Ranges (No one uses classful IP Addressing anymore)
        -Class C : 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (65,536 addresses) (Small Networks)
        -Class B : 172.16.0.0 -  172.31.255.255 (1,048,576 addresses) (Medium Networks)
        -Class A : 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (16,777,216 addresses) (Big Networks)
        -APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255
            -APIPA is a function of an opearting system in which it assigns a computer an APIPA address when the DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server is not reachable.

1.8 Configure and verify IPv6 addressing and prefix


1.9 Compare IPv6 address types

    1.9.a Global unicast
    1.9.b Unique local
    1.9.c Link local
    1.9.d Anycast
    1.9.e Multicast
    1.9.f Modified EUI 64
    

1.10 Verify IP parameters for Client OS (Windows, Mac OS, Linux)


1.11 Describe wireless principles

    1.11.a Nonoverlapping Wi-Fi channels
    1.11.b SSID
    1.11.c RF
        Wi-Fi uses two radio frequencies to transmit data 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz
    1.11.d Encryption


1.12 Explain virtualization fundamentals (virtual machines)


1.13 Describe switching concepts

    1.13.a MAC learning and aging
        MAC learning is when a switch examines a frem by learning their source MAC address and identifying the ports in which the frames where received from
        MAC Aging defines the time before an entry in a MAC Table is discarded this ranges from 0 to 1000000 the default value is 300 seconds.
    1.13.b Frame switching
        The switch builds a forwarding table of known MAC Addresses and uses this information to make decesions about how to forward frames.
    1.13.c Frame flooding
        When a switch recieves a packet meant for an unknown MAC address the switch sends the incoming frame to all occupied and active ports(Except the one it was recieved from)
        If the device it was meant for responds the switch learns this devices MAC address and adds it to its CAM table.
        Switches flood frames inside VLANS meaning if a frame enters on a port in VLAN 1 then the switch will only flood that from out on other ports in VLAN 1 
    1.13.d MAC address table 
       Also known as a CAM Table (Content Addressable Memory), A switch stores a known MAC Address within this table.
