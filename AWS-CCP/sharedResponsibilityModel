What is the shared responsibility model?
    
    AWS Manages the security of the cloud, security in the cloud is the responsibility of the customer
    The customer retains control of what security they choose to implement to preotect their own content no differently than they would in a data 
    center


    Is this something you can do in the AWS console you are likely responsible
    If not AWS is most likely responsible

    Encryption is a shared responsibility
