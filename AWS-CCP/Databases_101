What is a relational database?
    
    - Uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database
      these are often organized into tables


AmazonRDS (Relational Database Service) Key features
    
    - Multi-AZ - for disaster recovery
            Deploy your AmazonRDS accross multiple availiablity zones, in the event of a failure amazon will fail over to another zone automatically

    - Read-Rieplicas - For performance
           - Writes that are made to a primary database and replicated to a secondary database, There is not an automatic fail over however
           - You can set your EC2 instances to do their writes to the primary database then do their reads from the secondary databsei


What is a non-relational database

    These consist of :
        
        Collections     = Table
        Document        = Row
        Key Value Pairs = Fields

Non relation Databases are as follows :

    - The columns in the tables can vary
    - This will not affect other rows in the databases
    - This offers much more flexibility

    - SQL, MySQL, PostgresSQL, etc. are considered Relational Databases

Amazons Non-Relational Database is called DynamoDB


OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) vs OLAP (Online Analytics Processing)

    - OLTP captures and maintains transaction data in a database
    - OLAP appliex complex queries to large amounts of historical data, aggregated from OLTP Databases and other sources for data mining and
      analytics  This causes a massive performance hit on your database


What is Data Warehousing

    - Allows you to perform OLAP away from your production database by creating a secondary database that is built for OLAP queries
    - Data warehousing databases use different types of architecture both from a database perspective and a infrastructure layer
    - Amazons data warehousing solution is called redshift

What is ElastiCache

    - This is a web service that makes it easy to deploy,operate, and scale an in-memory cache in the cloud. 
    - This improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast,managed,in-memory caches instead of
      relying entirely on slower disk-based databases
    - Caches your most common queries in the cloud to take the load off your live database
    - ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines :
        - Memcached
        - Redis
