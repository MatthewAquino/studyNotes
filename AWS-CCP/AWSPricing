AWS philosophy on pricing :

    Pay as you go for what you use, pay less as you use more and pay even less when you reserve capactiy.

CapEX vs OPEX

    - Capex stands for capital expenditure which is where you pay up front, its a fixed sunk cost

    - OPEX stands for Operational Expenditure which is where you pay for what you use, think Utility billing such as electricity,gas,water,etc.

Pricing Policies

    - Pay as you go
    - Pay less when you reserve
    - Pay even less per unit by using more
    - Pay even less as AWS grows
    - Custom pricing

Pricing Best Practices

    - Understand the fundamentals of pricing
        - Three drivers of cost in AWS:
            - Compute
            - Storage
            - Data outbound
    - Start early with cost optimization
        - Start early with cost optimization
        - Easier to do so when the enviroment is small
    - Maximize the power of flexibility
        - By turning off resource when it is not in use reduces  cost by up to 70%
    - Use the right pricing model for the job
        - Use the correct tier for your companies needs
        - There are some free services
            - VPC
            - Elastic Beanstalk
            - CloudFormation
            - IAM
            - Auto scaling
            - Opsworks
            - Consoldiated Billing

EC2 Pricing Models

    - On demand
        - Pay as you go
    - Reserved
        - Provides you with a capcity reservation at a discount
    - Spot
        - Bid for whatever price you want for instance capacity
        - Provides greater savings for applications that have flexible start/end times
    - Dedicated Hosts
        - Physical EC2 Server dedicated for your use
        - For server bound licensing


Lambda Pricing

    - Request Pricing :
        - Free Tier: 1 Million requests per month
        - $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter
    - Duration Pricing
        -400,000GB-Second per month free, upt o 3.2 million seconds of compute time
        - 0.00001667 for every GB-Second used thereafter


AWS Budgets VS Cost explorer

    AWS Budget 
        - Give you the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed your budgeted amount
        - Used to budget costs BEFORE they have been incurred
    Cost Explorer
        - Lets you visualize, understand and manage yout AWS Costs and usage over time
        - Used to explore costs AFTER they have been incurred
