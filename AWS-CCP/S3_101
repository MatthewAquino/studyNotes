What does S3 Stand for and what does it do?

    - Simple Storage Service 
    - S3 is a place to put your flat files (A file that does not change)
    - S3 is an object-based storage (A place where you store your files)
    - The data is stored in multiple places and across multiple facilites

Basics of S3 

    - S3 is Object-Baed (Allows you to upload files)
    - Files can from 0 Bytes to 5TB
    - There is unlimited storege
        - When you upload a file to S3 you will recieve an http 200 if it is successfull
    - Files are stored in buckets (Folders in the cloud)
        -Buckets share a universal namespace (Names must be unique globally)

S3 Objects

    S3 Objects are a Key-Value Store

    Objecsts consist of :
        - A Key (The name of the object)
        - Value (This is the data)
        - Version ID (Important for versioning)
        - Metadata (Data about data you are storing )
        Subresources ;
            Access Control Lists (ACL)
            Torrents


Data consistency 

    - Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects ;
        - If you write a new file(PUTting a file in S3) and read it immediatley afterwards, you will be able to 
        view that data
    - Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (have to propagate) ;
        - If you update an EXISTING FILE or delete a file and read it immediatley, you may get the older version
        or you may not 
        - Changes to objects can take time to propagate

Exam Tips

    S3 Is object based 
    Files can be from 0Bytes to 5TB
    Unlimited storage
    Files are stored in buckets
    Bucket names need to be unique globally
    Links look like : S3 - Region . amazonaws.com / Bucket name 
    Not able to install an OS on
    Successful uploads will generate a HTTP200 Status code
