 Three kinds of cloud computing types

     1. Infrastructure As A Service (IAAS)
         -You manage the server which can be physical or virtual as well as the operating system. Usually the data centre      provider
         has no access to your server (EC2)

     2. Platform As A Service (PAAS)
         - Someone else manages the underlying hardware and operating systems. You just worry about your application

     3. Software As A Service (SAAS)
         - You are provided a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider (Gmail)

 Three types of cloud computing deployments

     1. Public Cloud
         - AWS, Azure, GCP
     2. Hybrid
         - Mixture of public and private
     3. Private Cloud (On-Premise)
         - You manage it in your datacenter (Vmware,Hyper-V)
